    According to GoF definition, a state allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
    It can be drawn from above definition that there shall be a separate concrete class per possible state of an object.


    In any application, when we are dealing with an object which can be in different states during it’s life-cycle and
    how it processes incoming requests (or make state transitions) based on it’s present state – we can use the state pattern.
